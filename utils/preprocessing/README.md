# Text Preprocessing Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a **Text Preprocessing Pipeline** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**. It cleans and normalizes text data by removing noise, handling abbreviations, and improving text quality for further processing.

### **Key Features**
- **HTML Tag Removal**: Strips out HTML tags from text.
- **URL Removal**: Eliminates website links.
- **Punctuation Removal**: Removes special characters and punctuations.
- **Chat Abbreviation Expansion**: Converts common chat slang into full words.
- **Spelling Correction**: Uses `TextBlob` to correct misspelled words.
- **Stopword Removal**: Removes commonly used words that do not add much meaning.
- **Emoji Conversion**: Converts emojis into their text representation.

## **Techniques Used**
### **1. HTML Tag Removal**
Many datasets contain HTML tags that need to be removed for cleaner text processing.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "<p>Hello World!</p>"
After Removing HTML Tags: "Hello World!"
```

---
### **2. URL Removal**
URLs are often unnecessary for text analysis and can be removed.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "Check out https://example.com"
After URL Removal: "Check out"
```

---
### **3. Punctuation Removal**
Punctuation does not contribute much to text meaning and is removed.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "Hello, World!"
After Punctuation Removal: "Hello World"
```

---
### **4. Chat Abbreviation Expansion**
Chat abbreviations are expanded to make sentences more meaningful.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "BRB, I'm coming ASAP"
After Expansion: "Be Right Back, I'm coming As Soon As Possible"
```

---
### **5. Spelling Correction**
`TextBlob` is used to correct spelling errors.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "Ths is an exampl"
After Correction: "This is an example"
```

---
### **6. Stopword Removal**
Common words like "the", "is", "in" are removed to retain meaningful content.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "The dog is running in the park"
After Stopword Removal: "dog running park"
```

---
### **7. Emoji Conversion**
Emojis are converted to text representations.

#### ‚úÖ **Example:**
```
Input: "I love Python! üòÉ"
After Conversion: "I love Python! :smiley:"
```

## **Advantages & Disadvantages**
| Technique | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **HTML & URL Removal** | Cleans text, removes unnecessary noise | Might remove useful data in some cases |
| **Punctuation Removal** | Standardizes text | May lose context in structured data |
| **Chat Abbreviation Expansion** | Enhances readability | Requires maintaining an updated abbreviation list |
| **Spelling Correction** | Improves text quality | Computationally expensive for large text |
| **Stopword Removal** | Reduces noise in text | Some stopwords may carry important meaning |
| **Emoji Conversion** | Makes text machine-readable | Some nuances of emojis may be lost |

---

## **Best Practices**
‚úÖ **Customize stopwords list** based on the context of the dataset.  
‚úÖ **Use `TextBlob` sparingly** as it can be computationally expensive.  
‚úÖ **Expand chat abbreviations before further text processing** to preserve meaning.  
‚úÖ **Ensure proper encoding** when working with emoji data.  
‚úÖ **Test with a sample dataset** before applying to large-scale text.

## **Project Workflow**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Load Raw Text Data**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply Preprocessing (HTML, URLs, Punctuation, Stopwords, etc.)**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Expand Abbreviations & Correct Spelling**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Convert Emojis to Text**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Store or Use Cleaned Text for NLP Models**  

---

## **Conclusion**
This project provides a **modular text preprocessing pipeline** that efficiently cleans and normalizes text for NLP tasks. It enhances text quality by removing noise, correcting errors, and improving readability.
